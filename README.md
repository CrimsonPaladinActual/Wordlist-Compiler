# Wordlist-Compiler

This tool combines multiple text (.txt) file wordlists into a single wordlist, while removing duplicates, for use with password cracking suites.
It is available as a Python script, or a stand-alone Windows executable. Both will do the exact same thing. 
For ease of use a GUI is incorporated.
Using the tool:
  - Place all .txt files to be combined in a folder.
  - Open the tool and select "Browse" for Source Folder to navigate to, and select, the folder containing the .txt files to be combined.
  - Select "Browse" to navigate to, and select, the desired location for the output .txt file, and name the output.
  - Select "Combine Password Lists"
  - At this time the progress bar will start to move. Depending on the size of the wordlists being combined the tool may go unresponsive. It is still
    working. To verify, view the process in Task Manager.
  - The tool will prompt when work is completed.
